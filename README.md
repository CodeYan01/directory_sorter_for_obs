# Directory Sorter for OBS

A Python script for OBS to update the playlist of a Media Playlist Source, VLC
Video Source, or Image Slideshow source, with the files found in a specified
directory, with the ability to have the playlist sorted by datetime modified or
filename. Similar to Exeldro's [Directory Watch
Media](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/directory-watch-media.801/)

Note: Exeldro's plugin is probably better than this script, but it doesn't
support Media Playlist Source yet; I'll have to contact the author. I wrote this
script not knowing their plugin already can sort files.

## Installation
1. Make sure that you have at least Python 3.11+.
2. In OBS, go to Tools > Scripts.
3. In the Python Settings tab, set your python installation path.
4. In the Scripts tab, add the directory_sorter_for_obs.py.

## Contact Me
Although there is a discussion tab in these forums, I would see your message
faster if you ping me (@CodeYan) in the [OBS Discord server](https://discord.gg/obsproject),
in #plugins-and-tools. Please do report bugs or if there are features you'd like
to be added.
